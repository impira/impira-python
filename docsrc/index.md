# Impira SDK

Release v{{version}}.

The Impira SDK is a Swiss Army Knife for working with [Impira](https://www.impira.com/) on the command line. It includes a Python library for working
with the Impira API and a command line tool (`impira`) for snapshotting collections, inferring fields (through [AWS Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/)),
and setting up collections based on snapshotted data.
